In the first part of this self study, you should finish the exercises from last time covering basic concepts for learning neural networks.

Afterwards, continue with the Jupyter notebook below (you need to have Jupyter installed to run the notebook). Here you should implement and experiment with a small neural network using primarily numpy and basic PyTorch functionality.
